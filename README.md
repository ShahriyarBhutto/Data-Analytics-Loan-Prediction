## Project Title 
**Predicting Bank Loan Eligibility for Applicants**
### Project Summary: 
**Problem Statement:** A bank wants to automate their loan eligibility validation system to save time and 
resources. 
### Objective:
To predict whether an applicant is eligible for loan or not.
### Methodology 
Following is the methodology of work that will be followed to execute the project: 
1. Load the dataset into notebook and describe / analyze it 
2. Data Preprocessing: 
2a. finding null/missing values 
2b. filling null/missing values 
2c. fixing wrong data types 
3. EDA (both univariate and multivariate):  
3a. plotting numerical data based on available categories (gender, marital status etc.) 
3b. plotting numerical data based on aggregations (average income, average loan applied etc.) 
4. Feature Engineering: including only relevant features in the data model 
5. Logarithmic scaling to numeric data to standardize all income & loan values 
5. Correlation Analysis 
6. Label Encoding 
7. Training of data model: 
7a. specifying input and output variables 
7b. splitting data into training data and test data 
7c. model selection & training 
7d. finding out model accuracy of the selected models (confusion matrix can be used) 
### Expected Outcomes and Deliverables 
The developed model should be able to predict whether a new customer is eligible for loan or not, based 
on their income, loan amount, demographic information and credit history.
